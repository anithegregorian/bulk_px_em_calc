I often find it difficult to follow design patterns and design systems. Each adds a different variation of `spacings`, `font-size` and `line-height`.

While most find it easy to just plugin the defaults of **Bootstrap**, **TailwindCSS** and override them resulting in an over-bloated CSS, its not a good practice.
